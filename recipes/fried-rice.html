    <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> This recipe is for fried rice. I've made a variation of fried rice since I was in college and it is one of the few things I can cook. Pretty easy to mix in leftovers to make it delicious!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Rice. This can be white or brown. Ideally leftover rice, as it's stickier and provides better adherence so your fried rice does not fall apart.</li>
        <li> Vegetables of your favorite variety. I personally prefer corn, peas, and carrots. </li>
        <li> Spices</li> Spices</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Salt</li>
                <li> Pepper. Can be course or fine depending on your texture preference. I like to add white pepper with black pepper personally</li>
                <li> Additional spices such as Mrs. Dashes "Onions and Herbs" blend.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> Meat. This can be chicken, pork, bacon, etc. </li>
        <li>Other ingredients. I like to add eggs!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Cut up your ingredients such as vegetables or meats. I like to cut my bacon in to very small bits. </li>
        <li> <strong> I like to scramble my eggs at this point if I have any.</strong></li>
        <li> Cook your meat in a skillet on medium heat on your stovetop. If using bacon you don't need to add any oil as the fat in the bacon will be enough, otherwise add a small amount of cooking oil to prevent sticking of the pan.</li>
        <li> Cook your rice in the pan with your meat. Add cooking oil if needed to prevent sticking. I like to add a dash of soy sauce at this point as well. </li>
        <li> Add you vegetables and cook thoroughly. Ensure your meat and veggies are up to temperature to prevent food poisoning.</li>
        <li> Add your spices and flavorings and any additional ingredients. Mix thoroughly. </li>
        <li> Turn off the heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Serve! </li>
    </ol>
