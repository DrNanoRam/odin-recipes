<h3> Description </h3>
<p>If you are anything like me, you love the tast of top ramen. 
    The problem though is that it isn't particularly healthy. 
    Here is a way to add to it to make it at least a little more nutritious.</p>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Top Ramen. Pick whatever flavor of combination of flavors you enjoy. </li>
    <li> Veggies. It is easiest to get a mixed back of frozen veggies at the store. </li>
    <li> Butter </li>
    <li> Any meats you want </li>
    <li> Eggs if you want. </li>
    <li> Spices such as salt, pepper, onion powder, or even a mixed blend such as Mrs. Dash.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol>
    <li> Cut up and cook your meats in a skillet to the appropriate temperature.</li>
    <li> Add butter to a pan and cook your veggies. </li>
    <li> Boil an egg for 5-10 minutes, depending on how hard you want it. Afterwards, run the egg under cold water and remove the shell. </li>
    <li> Cook your packet of ramen per the instructions on bag. Aftwards, add all your other cooked ingredients and any spices. </li>
    <li> Enjoy!</li>
